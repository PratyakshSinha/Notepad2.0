# Notepad2.0

The Following Source files can be downloaded then run in QT Creator for building the application which will work perfectly.
  
All the basic functionality of a text editor are there like save document, open document, Cut, Copy, paste, etc.
Along with these features I've Implemented 3 more feature that are Bold, Subscript and superscript.

There were many challenges while creating this application, first of all this application is not working without the QT Creator IDE. Along with this the text selection works only in one direction i.e. if I select text from right to left and try to unbold text it won't work but if its done the other way aroundt it works perfectly.

The most important feature of this application is that it is light weight and can basically run on any system efficiently.
